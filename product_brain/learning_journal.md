# Learning Journal

Purpose:
- Track concepts I had to learn / debug.
- Capture how we fixed them in my own words.
- Turn those into interview talking points.

Format rule for Orion:
- Append new entries at the bottom.
- Each entry should be short and high-signal.
- Use this template:

## [DATE] Topic: <short name>
**What broke / what I saw:**  
<1-2 lines in my words>

**Root cause (plain):**  
<why it actually happened>

**How we fixed it:**  
<what we changed, at a code / config level>

**Why this matters for interviews:**  
<how this proves I'm thinking like an engineer>
