# 🧠 Creator Pulse Dashboard

A cross-platform dashboard that aggregates and visualizes public posts from **Facebook**, **Instagram**, and **Threads** — designed to explore *data-driven UX inside the Meta ecosystem.*

Think of it as a modern, open-source evolution of **TweetDeck** — reimagined for Meta surfaces.  
This project is part of a self-directed bootcamp to bridge **data science, design systems, and front-end engineering.**

## 🚀 Vision

- **Phase 1: Foundation** → ✅ *Complete*  
  Bootstrapped with Next.js + TypeScript + StyleX. Established project architecture and dev environment.  
- **Phase 2: UI Shell & Components** → *In Progress*  
  Building the base dashboard shell — sidebar, header, and feed panels for Meta platforms.  
- **Phase 3: Data Integration (Meta Surfaces)**  
  Introduce public or mock APIs for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads content.  
- **Phase 4: Visualization & Insights**  
  Add engagement charts, creator summaries, and interaction metrics (Recharts / D3).  
- **Phase 5: Product Polish & Deployment**  
  Deploy MVP to Vercel, refine accessibility and responsiveness, and document learning outcomes.

## 🧭 Core Design Principles

- 🧩 **Composable UI:** Each feed, filter, and post card is an independent component.  
- ⚡ **Performance by Design:** Public data only, async rendering, minimal dependencies.  
- 🔍 **Transparency:** Built in public to document the *Data Experience Engineer* journey.  
- 🧠 **Learn by Doing:** Each feature introduces one new engineering or design principle.
