# Creator Pulse Dashboard

A cross-platform dashboard that aggregates and visualizes public posts from creators across **TikTok**, **Instagram**, **Threads**, and **X (Twitter)**.

Think of it as a lightweight, platform-agnostic “TweetDeck” — built for creators, analysts, and social strategists who need one clean view of multiple feeds.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Creator Pulse** is an independent project exploring how creators and analysts can monitor public posts across platforms in one place — without switching apps.

- 🧩 **Platform-agnostic:** Modular adapters (TikTok, Instagram, Threads, X)
- 🧱 **Tech stack:** Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind · TanStack Query · oEmbed APIs
- 🔒 **Privacy-first:** Public data only — no scraping, no auth, no internal APIs
- 💡 **Goal:** Learn full-stack development through a real-world, data-driven project

---

## 🧭 MVP Scope (Phase 0)

1. Add and manage account handles / URLs
2. Fetch posts via **public oEmbed endpoints**
3. Display unified feed with filters by platform
4. Simple UI cards for post previews (text + media)
5. Deployed to Vercel (private MVP)
